This is a GitHub repository. This is where code changes can be tracked, added to and modified. We are going to use this to keep track of your programming in general, and your final projects will live here! 

Along side github, we are using GitHib classroom for me to set you assignments - coding tasks which need to be completed and uploaded back to Github (throgh a push) to hand in. I will also be able to chat with you, and work on your code with you if you get stuck. 

the GitHub classroom give you each individual forks of the source code (such as this readme file) so you can add things to this to make your own versions of the repos. 

>>>>>>>>TASK 1 - Go ahead and try this now - edit this file and add your name below 


>> your name = 


Once you've done that, you will be asked to puch the changes. Go ahead and do this. 



Github is a VERSION CONTROL system. This means you can take a copy of code, without changing it, make your own version, change that, then submit your changes to the owner of the code (in this case me) who can review and approve your changes. They are then merged with the main branch, and your changes are added to the codebase. This is how the coding industry works - every single job you eve go for will want you to be able to use git, so now seems as good a time to learn as any. 


In addition to this, we will be using the online IDE - repl.it - this is a fully featured web-based IDE with support for multiple languages, a simple Java graphics engine (so we can build GUI programs) and [beta] access to git repos from within the IDE. 

Projects in repl.it are called repls. You should have a new repl for every project, so you will have a lot before long - name them wisely. 
You will also have a git repo for every project - so name these wisely as well! 


>>>>>>>>Task 2 - Go and sign up for repl.it using your school email address.

>> confirm here that you have managed to sign up, and push the changes to the git repo again, to update this file.
